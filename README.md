### 📌 **LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction – Project Summary**  

#### **Objective**  
This project aimed to **predict stock prices** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model** built with **TensorFlow and Keras**. The model was trained on historical stock price data and used for future price forecasting.  

---

## **🔹 Steps & Methodology**  

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
- **Dataset**: Loaded stock price data from `EA_stock_price.csv`.  
- **Feature Selection**: Used **closing price** as the primary feature for prediction.  
- **Data Normalization**: Applied **MinMaxScaler** to scale prices between **0 and 1** for better LSTM performance.  
- **Sequence Generation**: Created sequences of **50 past days** to predict the next day's stock price.  

---

### **2️⃣ Model Development (LSTM) 🧠**  
- Built a **deep LSTM model** with the following layers:  
  ✅ **2 LSTM layers** (50 units each)  
  ✅ **Dropout layers** (20% to prevent overfitting)  
  ✅ **Dense layers** for final prediction  
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  

---

### **3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation 📊**  
- **Training**: Ran for **20 epochs** with a batch size of **16**.  
- **Loss Reduction**: Training & validation loss decreased steadily.  
- **Performance Metrics**:  
  ✅ **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** = **2.7681**  
  ✅ **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** = **3.2213**  
  ✅ **R² Score** = **0.9324** (**93.24% variance explained!**)  

---

### **4️⃣ Predictions & Visualizations 📈**  
- **Actual vs. Predicted Prices**: Plotted **LSTM predictions vs. actual stock prices** for comparison.  
- **Future Forecasting**: Predicted stock prices for the **next 30 days** using iterative prediction.  

---

## **🔹 Key Takeaways & Results**  
✅ **High accuracy** (R² = 93.24%) with **low prediction errors**.  
✅ **LSTM successfully captured stock price trends**.  
✅ **Future price predictions** provide insights into expected stock movements.  

---

## 🎯 **Final Verdict**  
This **LSTM-based stock price predictor** successfully models stock price trends and forecasts future prices with high accuracy. While improvements are possible, the current results demonstrate **strong predictive performance**.
